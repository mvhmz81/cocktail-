Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

one of my first projects which i have been working with to develop my skills.

Ran into many issues with CSS and learning how componenents pass props.

The project is a visual map of my progress and although not the finished product the MVP was to be able to search for cocktails and bring back cards.

The second MVP was to add the ingredient search

The third was to link an ingriedient search to pull the selected cocktail

Final chage was to CSS design to bring it forward in terms of looks

there is still more that can be done but to allow for more learning i will move on

the vite and bootstrap is not working
i think the system is corrupted and so i need to delete all
